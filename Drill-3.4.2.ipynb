    "Ans:\n",
    "The probability of H or T is 0.5 and since balanced coin indicates independent events....so probability of HTTH or HHHH or TTHH will be same i.e \n",

    "IV   A data scientist wants to study the behavior of users on the company website. Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot conclude about average users here because we have a sample bias.  Since,  we have data only on users that have completed survey and not users who did not complete the survey, we cannot generalize and conclude on all users.\n",
