--Drill 1.2.5
--What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

SELECT
	 t.duration, trip_id, date
FROM
	weather w 
JOIN
	trips t
ON
	w.date = CAST(CAST(t.start_date AS DATE) AS TEXT)
WHERE
	w.precipitationin > 0
GROUP BY duration, date, trip_id
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 3;

--Answer to Question 2 
--Which station is full most often?

SELECT	stn.name as Station_name, s.station_id, COUNT(s.timestamp) as Times_full
FROM	status s
JOIN	stations stn
ON s.station_id = stn.station_id
WHERE	s.docks_available = 0
GROUP BY	1,2
ORDER BY	3 DESC;

--Answer to Question 3 
--Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT	t.start_station, stn.station_id, COUNT(t.trip_id) as No_of_trips, stn.dockcount
FROM	stations stn
JOIN	trips t
ON	stn.name = t.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2, 4
ORDER BY stn.dockcount;

--Answer to Question 4 
--(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

SELECT date(start_date), MAX(duration)
FROM trips
JOIN weather
ON CAST(trips.start_date as DATE) = CAST(weather.Date as DATE)
WHERE precipitationin > 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
