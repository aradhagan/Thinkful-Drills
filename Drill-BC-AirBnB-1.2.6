FROM sfo_calendar c
JOIN sfo_listings l
ON c.listing_id = l.id
WHERE available = 't'
GROUP BY l.neighbourhood
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
--Another way to define popular is by the number of reviews i.e more often if reviews are published it is. 
--But here the reviews can be negative...so it popular for both negative or positive reviews.
